🚀 Exploring Restaurant Trends Through Data | Excel & Python Data Analysis Project 🔍📊
Excited to showcase one of my recent data analysis projects where I explored a rich restaurant dataset sourced from Zomato's public listing data!
The dataset titled: 👉 "Zomato Restaurants Data Analysis"
captures detailed information about restaurants, their pricing, customer ratings, online delivery options, and more — offering fascinating insights into the food and dining landscape of New Delhi and other regions.
📊 Key Insights Visualized: 🍽️ Distribution of average meal costs for two across different localities
 🌟 Relationship between average meal cost and customer ratings
 📱 Proportion of restaurants offering online delivery and table bookings
 🏷️ Cuisine preferences and pricing range segmentation
 📍 City-wise and locality-wise breakdown of restaurant density and average cost
🔧 Tools & Techniques Used:
 ✔ Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting)
 ✔ Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data wrangling & visualization)
 ✔ Data cleaning & transformation
 ✔ Visual storytelling techniques
📈 The analysis not only highlights how pricing and customer satisfaction vary across localities, but also helps identify areas with premium dining experiences versus budget-friendly hotspots.
This project stands as a great example of how publicly available datasets can be leveraged to extract meaningful business insights, support decision-making, and uncover trends in consumer behavior.
🙏 A heartfelt thank you to Savleen Kaur for their constant guidance and motivation throughout this project. Your mentorship added clarity and strategic direction to my approach!
